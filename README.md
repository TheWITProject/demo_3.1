## Summary
You will be demoing a schema for a zoo, like we designed in our object oriented design exercise but a little different. Please create your schema on a visual tool like [Ziteboard](ziteboard.com) or [Figma](https://www.figma.com/login).

**Table Creation**
- We should a Zoo table to store data about different zoos.
- We should have an Animal table to store data about animals we house with the fields name and species.
- We should have a Species table to store data about species with the fields average height, weight, and noise.

**Defining Properties**
- Let students define other properties and try to figure out what the best place for them would be!

**Relationships**
- Zoos is one-to-many with animals (or many-to-many if animals move between zoos frequently).
- Species is one-to-many with animals.

After definining the relationships, try to demonstrate how you you can get different information despite things being in a bunch of different tables. **For example, can we get a list of all of the pigs at a certain zoo?**
